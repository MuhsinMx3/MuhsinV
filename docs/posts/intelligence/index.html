<p>Currently, technology is ubiquitous, including in the field of education, where it has been shown to be very important in achieving student learning outcomes. Education is no longer just a text instruction or a memorizing requirement for a student. The teaching process, both inside and outside the classroom, has become a work with measurable goals and outcomes. Over time, educational strategies have been identified as part of the inputs and outcomes of the learning process. In addition, these practices have grown into a key component that plays a key role in enhancing the development of curriculum components, improving curriculum priorities, and making both effective and strategic. These components are used in the process of planning, implementing, evaluating, tracking and developing objectives. Machine learning has become a new frontier of higher education. As one of the most robust new technologies, machine learning plays a key role in intelligent and man-made interactions. Machine learning is a new tool used to fight cancer, climate change, and terrorism .New infrastructure for everything. As a result, machine learning enables computers to retrieve hidden information without having to be programmed to do so. In addition, machine learning serves as a good prediction.
Machine learning technology is used as a framework for educational activities. There are a variety of ways to use electronic learning technology in education, such as providing a variety of learning options so that the student can find what is best for him or her but in a way that takes into account the diversity of students. Machine learning can also be used to review a lesson that was difficult to understand. Machine learning in education works according to the needs of the students, and at a time and place that suits them best.
Practical assistance plays an important role in education and is a good platform for the use of learning materials. A visual assistant can participate in a discussion with students. These collaborations include chat agents that help students through the app or website. The process works is simple when the reader needs to enter text. On the other hand, agents do the job and determine the appropriate response to the input before giving a simple answer that the reader can easily understand.</p>
<p>Both machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are used to interpret patterns and human interactions that support in-depth learning and provide users with fast and accurate data. This chapter proposes a new educational framework that provides practical assistance. Provides customized student research. The suggested framework allows teachers to monitor their students' progress in their learning activities at any time. The best way to train students is to improve their knowledge. The framework also helps teachers save time that is often spent on lesson preparation, exam creation, text review, document production, and some enlightening research. The proposed framework facilitates the use of the most powerful technologies to improve the quality of student and teacher education. Another advantage associated with this machine learning framework with real assistants is that it is not uncommon for errors that tend to involve human activities. When an error occurs, the framework allows it to solve the problem easily and create the right solution for the error.</p>

<p>Machine Learning and AI have affected every aspect of a person&rsquo;s life, whether business, banking, communication, travel, health or education. It is true that teachers and teachers cannot be reinstated. However, technology will revolutionize the work of teachers and good study habits.
The academic world is becoming more ambitious and suitable for students. Digital type, dynamic and providing student engagement opportunities are not found in textbooks that are often outdated or in a standard classroom space enclosed by four walls. In this post, Parinita Gupta will talk about current trends and the scope of the future of machine learning and AI in the field of education.
According to the latest figures, 16% of US jobs have been lost over the past decade due to the development of EdTech and about 13.6 million new jobs have been created to address this growing trend and every university is proposed to teach artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. to students. The future of artificial intelligence and machine learning is very promising for the industry and shows great growth in the years to come.</p>

<h3 id="machine-learning">Machine learning</h3>
<p>At present, education and learning are still very much focused on feeding students with knowledge and hope that it will be preserved. Similarly, a student&rsquo;s intelligence is tested by examining their ability to remember details previously taught. The problem is that this model ignores you to check how well the learners understand the information and how they apply it in real situations. This model has been shown to be toxic over the years. Many schools and educational institutions have begun to see how the use of learning equipment can make work more efficient and convenient and has begun to embrace technology on a growing scale. Indeed, machine learning can embrace all types of students.
Machine learning algorithms analyze data to identify patterns as well develop a model used to predict future prices (for example, by pointing to patterns in historical stock data, AI predicts future stocks movement; by pointing to patterns in pictures of people with a name, it predicts who is shown in other images; and by identifying patterns of medical symptoms, predicts certain diagnoses). In other words, machine learning can be considered a three-step process (analyze data, create a model, perform an action) that is continuously driven (the results of the action produce new data, which converts model, which causes a new action). It is in this way that I the machine reads. Many recent applications (including native language processing, driving, and the Google DeepMind AlphaGo program that hit World&rsquo;s first player Go) All 62 were made available thanks making learning equipment. In fact, machine learning is widespread today that, for some analysts, AI and machine learning has become a thing is the same - and machine learning is a small field for AI. What is true, however, is that renewal and clear growth of AI over the past decade, has happened because of importance advances in machine learning (based, as we have seen, rapidly computer processors, availability of large amounts of big data, and new calculation methods).There are three main stages of machine learning: surveillance, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement.</p>

<h3 id="current-state-of-machine-learning">Current State of Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Last year’s report by Market Watch has revealed that Machine Learning in education will remain one of the top industries to drive investment, with the U.S. and Chine becoming the top key players by 2030. Major companies, like Google and IBM, are getting involved in making school education more progressive and innovative.
Big companies, such as Google and IBM, are involved in making schooling more efficient and effective.EdWeek also reports that AI in education will remain highly valued by investors, taking second place behind AR / VR technology as in the fig.</p>

<h3 id="why-we-need-mlai-in-education">WHY WE NEED ML/AI IN EDUCATION</h3>
<p>Machine Learning (ML) is playing a major role in reforming the education sector along with the other industries. Machine learning are having a tremendous impact on the teaching industry. Teaching industry is adopting new technologies to predict the future of education system. It is Machine learning which predict the future nature of education environment by adapting new advanced intelligent technologies. Especially during these times when the world is impacted by a pandemic everything is moving online. Students are adapting to the online/virtual classrooms, this is where machine learning come into play. With the help of machine learning and AL students will waste less time online, personalized machine learning software’s can help them. Machine learning algorithms uses pattern recognition to predict outcomes of a problem, in this case a student’s performance.
The machine learning algorithm can spot when a student repeatedly fail or struggles with a task/work, and the system can change the e-learning content to provide additional and more detailed information to help the student learn more efficiently. Machine learning can also learn about the student way of content consumption and it will adjust to deliver the e-learning content in a format that the student can understand. Machine learning can free teachers and administrators from big time-consuming work. For example, machine learning algorithms can help to automate scheduling and content delivery processes, students can get contents without the help of teachers directly. Scheduling coursework for online learners is a difficult and time-consuming task that can’t be skipped, so   is delivering online resources and contents for students. Artificial intelligence in schools can also enable the analysis of student capabilities and performance and point the way forward using predictive analytics. It can Test Students &amp; Grade Students Fairly (Machine learning can help creating computerized adaptive assessments. The machine learning based assessment gives constant feedback to teachers and students about how the student learns and how to learn more efficiently the support they need and the progress they are making towards their learning goals. Machine learning can also give personalized feedback to each student. These systems can follow a student’s progress and give targeted feedback in the form of additional or specially changed course work to help the student in studies. At an institute level, ML/AI technologies are helping streamline difficult institutional process, thus making them smarter &amp; more efficient. In the future, AL through the application of machine learning, will liberate professionals from big tasks, allowing them to proceed with more high-level and satisfying work and focus more on each students. There are a lot of AI applications for education that are being developed and used including AI mentors for learners, further development of smart content and a new method of personal development for educators through virtual global conferences. Education sector might be a bit slower to the adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning than economy or business sector, but the changes are starting and will continue and it will change the way of teaching and learning.<br>
Machine learning and artificial intelligence have a tremendous impact on the field of teaching. We are already in a changing world where each day new technologies is changing the way we live, as part of this our way of teaching and learning is also changing a lot. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way humans live their life. The research methodology taken by AI is the use of data acquired from a system to develop models, understand its complexity, and solve pertinent problems through these models. The ﬁeld of education is going through a paradigm shift through the use of AI which can be used to unleash insights about understanding how students learn, how to personalize the learning experience of students, how to get more information to help in the decision-making process, how to model the complex interaction between student learning, the knowledge do-main, and the tools that helps enable students to interact and learn with the domain. Indeed, AI is relevant to addressing education-related problems that are rooted in both the shortcomings of the traditional way of teaching the current generation and the complexity of the educational system itself. In particular, e-learning is making a huge amount of data available that will enable AI to address complex challenges in education and adopt smarter educational technology solutions. Over the past decade, the role of AI in learning has been on the radar of education institutions, government agencies, funding agencies.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-artificial-intelligence-in-education">How to Use Artificial Intelligence in Education</h3>
<p>ML tends to analyse information, get conclusions, and make decisions or suggestions. It means that the ML-based platform can be taught with a lot of data. After that, it can full-fill various tasks.</p>
<p><em>Individualized Learning</em></p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence allows focusing on the individual needs of the student. Many large education platforms like Carnegie Learning invest in AI to provide more personalized courses. These days, it’s possible to create individual instructions, testing, and feedback. As a result, learners work with the material they are ready for and fill the gaps in their knowledge.</p>
<p><em>Voice Assistants</em></p>
<p>Such voice assistants as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Home allow interacting with various learning materials without communication with a teacher. As a result, it’s possible to use an education platform anywhere and anytime.
For example, Arizona State University uses Alexa for routine campus needs. The assistant can answer common questions or follow the student’s schedule.
Additionally, using such assistants, it quite interesting and exciting for learners, so they are mare engaged in the education process.</p>
<p><em>Global Learning</em></p>
<p>AI brings a lot of opportunities to share knowledge all over the world. Using Artificial Intelligence solutions, students can study various courses and training programs.
AI also provides opportunities for students who speak different languages or have visual or hearing problems. For example, Presentation Translator is an AI-based solution that creates subtitles in real-time mode. Using AI Speech Recognition, students can hear or read in their native language.</p>

<h3 id="machine-learning-will-revolutionize-the-education-sector">MACHINE LEARNING WILL REVOLUTIONIZE THE EDUCATION SECTOR</h3>
<p>Old school educators are having a hard time getting used to machines having the ability to think and learn. Suggesting to them that machine learning is going to revolutionize the education field usually falls on deaf ears. However, sooner or later, they will have to come to grips with this new reality.
For my readers who are new to the concept, machine learning is defined as is defined as “a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to “learn” (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.” For example, in education, we see machine learning in learning analytics and artificial intelligence.
In this piece, I want to discuss 6 ways machine learning will revolutionize the education sector.</p>
<ol>
<li>Increasing efficiency. Machine learning in the form of artificial intelligence has the potential to make educators more efficient by completing tasks such as classroom management, scheduling, etc. In turn, educators are free to focus on tasks that cannot be achieved by AI, and that require a human touch.</li>
<li>Learning analytics. Machine learning in the form of learning analytics can help teachers gain insight into data that cannot be gleaned by using the human brain. In this capacity, computers can perform deep dives into data, sifting through millions of pieces of content, and making connections and conclusions that positively impact the teaching and learning process.</li>
<li>Predicative analytics. Machine learning in the form of predictive analytics can make conclusions about things that may happen in the future. For instance, using a data set of middle school students’ cumulative records, predictive analytics can tell us which ones are more likely to drop out because of academic failure or even their predicated score on a standardized exam, such as the ACT or SAT.</li>
<li>Adaptive learning. Machine learning in the form of adaptive learning can be used to remediate struggling students or challenge gifted ones. Adaptive learning is a technology-based or online educational system that analyses a student’s performance in real time and modifies teaching methods and the curriculum based on that data. Think AI meets dedicated math tutor meets personalized engagement.</li>
<li>Personalized learning. Machine learning in the form of personalized learning could be used to give each student an individualized educational experience. Personalized learning is an educational model where students guide their own learning, going at their own pace and, in some cases, making their own decisions about what to learn. Ideally, in a classroom using personalized learning, students choose what they’re interested in, and teachers fit the curriculum and standards to the students’ interests.</li>
<li>Assessment. Machine learning in the form of artificial intelligence can be used to grade student assignments and exams more accurately than a human can. It may require some input from a human being, but the results will have higher validity and reliability.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>Widening participation in educational activity and also the continuous increase in the number of students in education, class sizes, staff costs, and broader financial pressures on universities makes the employment of technology or teacherbots a really attractive solution. This became a problem when massive open online courses (MOOCs) enlightened the imagination of the many university administrators. The understanding of “open courses” is that no entry requirements or fees were required, and online students could enrol and participate from any country or around the world with internet access. Both of those factors enabled universities to plug globally for college students, leading to massive enrolment numbers. The promise was generous, but it soon became evident that one in every of the issues created for teachers was their human capacity to actively engage with massive numbers of diverse students studying globally from different time zones, at different rates of progress and with different frames of reference and foundational skills for the course that they&rsquo;re studying. Assisting students in large classes to progress effectively through their learning experience to realize desired outcomes, conduct assessments, and supply constructive personalized feedback remained unsolved issues.
Many individuals picture a robot or a terminator when they catch wind of Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, they aren’t something out of motion pictures, it is anything but a cutting edge dream. It’s already here. We are living in a situation with numerous cutting edge applications developed using machine learning, despite that there are certain challenges an ML practitioner might face while developing an application from zero to bringing them to production.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Implementation of AI technology is giving many opportunities for development of massive open online courses. Assessment of a large number of assignments, tasks, detection of learning and teaching gaps would not be a problem anymore with the adaption of intelligent machine learning systems. Moreover, measuring learning progress is becoming more and more effective. But also at the same time these intelligent machine learning systems can skip some correct but some rare unique solutions, since the system make decision based on the massive statistic and learn from other data’s. It means that assessment systems based on AI can’t be absolutely true in every possible situation without a human mentor. This is one of its problems but with more data and more powerful machine learning tools it can be reduced. Another important point is that in fact, intelligent tutoring systems create a digital profile of a student and provide him with a personal tutor according to his needs. That again should increase a student’s productivity inside a classroom and out of it. Also, such digital portfolios of learned subjects and topics can be of great help for employers. Personalized learning environment not only improves a quality of educational process, it also gives an opportunity for schoolchildren and students with difficulties such as dyslexia or other health issues to study more effective. It will also help to adopt educational content to students’ needs developing more individualized study plans. From the overview it is clear that AI tools are already implemented in many parts of educational process including content development, teaching methods, student assessment, and communication between teacher and students. This work contributes to existing knowledge on this domain and will be interesting to professionals in the field of technology enhanced learning, lecturers, students and people who cares about state of the art of our education.</p>
